# Tableau for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
Project Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization for an online retail store, focusing on key business metrics to help guide the companyâ€™s expansion strategy. The CEO and CMO have outlined specific requirements for understanding the company's revenue, demand, and customer behavior. Using Tableau, the following visualizations were created to meet these needs and provide actionable insights.

Repository Structure
File Name: OnlineRetail_Analysis.twbx
Tool Used: Tableau
Data Source: [Online Retail Dataset]
Visualizations: The workbook contains four separate visualizations, each addressing a key question posed by the CEO and CMO.
Visualizations
1. Q1 - Monthly Revenue Trends (2011)
Objective: The CEO is interested in understanding seasonal revenue trends over the year 2011 to aid in forecasting future revenues.
Visualization: A line chart was created to display the revenue data on a monthly basis, highlighting peaks and trends throughout the year.
Key Insight: This analysis identifies which months generated the highest and lowest revenue, helping to anticipate seasonal trends for planning.
2. Q2 - Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK)
Objective: The CMO wants to identify the top 10 revenue-generating countries, excluding the United Kingdom, and view the associated sales quantities.
Visualization: A stacked bar chart shows both the revenue and quantity sold by the top 10 countries.
Key Insight: This visualization helps identify key international markets driving revenue, allowing for focused marketing strategies in those regions.
3. Q3 - Top 10 Customers by Revenue
Objective: The CMO aims to focus on the top 10 customers by revenue to ensure customer satisfaction and retention.
Visualization: A column chart ranks the top 10 customers by revenue, from the highest to the lowest.
Key Insight: This helps the CMO identify high-value customers and prioritize customer retention efforts.
4. Q4 - Demand by Region (Excluding UK)
Objective: The CEO is looking to identify regions with high product demand to prioritize expansion efforts.
Visualization: A map chart was used to display demand across various countries, excluding the United Kingdom.
Key Insight: This provides a geographic representation of product demand, making it easier to identify regions for potential business growth.
